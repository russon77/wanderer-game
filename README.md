Welcome! This is a proof-of-concept game based on a from-scratch Entity-Component-Systems implementation. The game is
written in Python with Pygame as the major dependency for output to screen, timers, etc. and pytmx - a small tmx
reading library along with some support code for drawing tmx maps to screen in pygame. I made the choice to use Tiled
as the level editor to force a level of open-ended content.
